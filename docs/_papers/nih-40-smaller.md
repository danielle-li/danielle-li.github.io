The FY2026 President's Budget Request would cut the National Institute of Health (NIH) budget by 40%. To gauge the potential effect of very large cuts to the NIH, such as those proposed, we analyze 28 years of NIH extramural awards and their peer review scores to identify the bottom 40% of grants that would have been eliminated from 1980 to 2007, had a cut of this magnitude been implemented historically. We then identify drugs approved in the 21st century that are linked to these at-risk grants. Ten drugs have patents that directly acknowledge research support from at-risk grants, and more than 50% cite at least one research publication funded by at-risk grants. Drugs which are linked to at-risk grants are of similar quality to other drugs. These findings demonstrate that cuts to even lower-ranked NIH grants can jeopardize research that ultimately informs drug development.
