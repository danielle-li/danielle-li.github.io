  <p><span class="font-medium">Abstract: </span>Absent explicit quotas, incentives, reporting, or fiscal year-end motives, drug approvals around the world surge in December and at the end of each month. This pattern is found in a large, global data set consisting of drug approvals from the United States, the European Union, Japan, China, and South Korea, suggesting that this pattern reflects an empirical regularity common across cultures and regulatory regimes.  In the United States, the number of December drug approvals is roughly 80% larger than in any other month.  Similar approval spikes occur at the end of each calendar month.  Additionally, approvals spike before holidays, such as before Thanksgiving in the United States and the Chinese New Year in China (but not vice versa).  Drugs approved in December and at month-ends are associated with significantly more adverse effects, including more hospitalizations, life-threatening incidents, and deaths.  This pattern is consistent with a model in which regulators rush to meet internal production benchmarks associated with salient calendar periods: this type of "desk-clearing" behavior results in more lax review, which leads both to increased output and increased safety issues.</p>
