To add a new paper:

1. Create a new .md file in docs/_papers/ with whatever name you want like my_watermelon_paper.md
2. Copy the contents of another paper's .md file from that directory into your new file
3. Adjust the title (may require putting it in double quotes if it contains a colon or dash)
4. Add collaborators, or remove the entire "collaboration: with ..." line if there are none
5  Set the category to one of the four you see below in the | where: "category", "CATEGORY NAME HERE" clauses:
  - working
  - accepted-forthcoming-published
  - other-writing
  - older-working-papers
6. Set the custom_order: [number] in the new .md file to specify the order in which it appears
  - Lower numbers appear first
  - The order is per category
  - If you accidentally give multiple the same number, nothing will break and they all will appear
7. Set the content of the new paper as required
  - The content is the part below the `---`
  - It can contain whatever HTML or markdown you want

Each paper block on the page will be generated by using the template in docs/_layouts/paper.md
